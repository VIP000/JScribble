=========

An Interactive collaboration board experiment made with node.js, Angular.js, socket.io and easel.js...

Clone it and just run node app.js. Then open two different browsers (not two windows or tabs of the same browser since
I am using cookies), start chating and drawing.


This was mostly done as an experiment/learning experience to cut my teeth on angular.js, socket.io and node.js.

JScribble
=========

An collaboration board (chat and drawing) experiment made with node.js, Angular.js, socket.io and easel.js...

Clone it and just run node app.js. Then open two different browsers (not two windows or tabs of the same browser since
I am using cookies), start chating and drawing.

This was mostly done as an experiment/learning experience mostly to cut my teeth on angular.js, socket.io and node.js.

An instance of JScribble is curently running on heroku at 
[murmuring-scrubland-9020.herokuapp.com](http://murmuring-scrubland-9020.herokuapp.com).
Keep in mind I have not implemented any kind of session/chat room, everybody can see everything
you do in JScribble, one worldwide completly public collaboration board.

Tested on Chrome and Safari, probably won't work on IE, YMMV on Firefox. Also I have not put any effort at all in supporting
touch for drawgin and in making the layour work on mobile.
